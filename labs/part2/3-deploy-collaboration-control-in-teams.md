# Deploy Collaboration controls to Microsoft Teams

Collaboration controls currently work best within Microsoft Teams. You can create a new app that can be embedded inside Teams app as both, a personal app and a tab app.

## Configure the app for Teams

The app that you've created in [create a model-driven application](2-app-with-collaboration-controls.md#create-a-model-driven-application) only have a single left pane and there are no complex commands. So before adding your app into Teams, you can hide the left pane and make more comprehensible header view.

> **NOTE**
> 
> Don't enable the following steps if you want to display the left pane and high-density header to your users.

To do so, we'll use Power Apps **new app** settings.

1. Go to **Solutions** in the left pane.

1. Go to the bottom of your solutions list and select **Default solution**.

1. Search for and select **Setting definition**.

2. Search and select **Hide the navbar** from the list of settings definitions. This hides the left pane in your application.

3. On the lower right  of your application in the edit pane, there's a section titled **Setting app values**. If you created your app using the modern app designer, your app appears on the list. Select **New app value** under your app.

4. Change the value from **No** to **Yes.**

5. Select **Save.**

6. Search and select **App high density page header** from the list of settings definitions and repeat the process.

## Add the app to Microsoft Teams app catalog

As the settings are defined, you can now add the app to Microsoft Teams. To start with, browse to the **Apps** page in the Power Apps maker portal and find the app that you've created and select ellipse **â€¦**.

To add the app to Teams, select **Add to Teams**.
